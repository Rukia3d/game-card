7,1,6,serious,L,Final exams are in progress. Find a team to join and I'll get you your first task
0,2,0,excited,L,"Good day, headmaster! I am here to..."
0,3,6,serious,R,Are you here for your final tests? Good. As I can see you haven't got your team yet. You need to fix it.
0,4,0,sad,L,"But... I thought you will assign me a team, isn't that how things work?"
0,5,6,serious,R,"No, it's not. You can choose who you pass your exams with. All people have their strength and weaknesses."
0,6,6,serious,R,It's up you to to figure out what works best. Do you understand?
0,7,0,serious,L,I guess so. So what should I do?
0,8,6,serious,R,Check out the garden. It's a popular place for students to rest and socialise. 
1,9,1,happy,R,Maya! Hi! Surprised to see you here! I thought you already have found a team
1,10,0,huh,L,"Oh... Nell, is it? Yes I need to find a team, Master Olija insists..."
1,11,1,excited,R,Do you think I can join you? I promise I'll be super helpful! Do you have a task from Olija?
1,12,0,serious,L,"Master Olija. No, she said I should get back to her when I have a team"
2,13,7,excited,R,"Here you are, my little friends! Please proceed to the Arena for your final training session, before the real thing."
2,14,0,huh,L,"I don't really like fighting, but if we have to, let's do it."
2,15,7,happy,R,All you need to do is to make sure your opponent runs out of thei spells!
2,16,7,happy,R,Good luck!
3,17,0,happy,L,Glad that is over. Let's talk to Olija and see what else we need to do to graduate.
3,18,1,excited,R,"Wow, it's Tara, let's grab her into the team? Have you seen her with a sword? It's almost magical..."
3,19,0,huh,L,I heared she's not good with magic at all. But I guess we will need another girl anyway...
3,20,0,happy,L,"Tara, right? Do you want to join my team? I have a spot I need to feel."
3,21,2,huh,R,"You are clearly desperate if you approach me. Nell, are you joining this pretentious..."
3,22,1,huh,M,"Oh, there's no need to get unplesant. Tara, please join us, we could use a swords... woman on a team."
3,23,2,huh,R,Show me what you got and I'll consider joining you!
4,24,2,serious,R,Wasn't overly impressive but it'll do. I'll join you for now.
4,25,2,huh,R,Just don't talk to me unless you have to.
5,26,1,excited,M,Look over there. I think this guy's name is Grey. Shall we talk to him?
5,27,3,huh,R,No
5,28,0,sad,L,But I haven't even asked...
5,29,3,serious,R,You're looking for people to join your team and you don't have much choice so you got to me.
5,30,2,serious,M,Pretty close actually. Are you drowning in invites or what?
5,31,3,huh,R,"Not really. I'll have to do this to graduate, right?"
5,32,0,happy,L,"If you plan to graduate, yes. You're stayed back a couple of years, haven't you?"
5,33,3,huh,R,I guess I avoided this as much as I could. Just don't expect much of me.
5,34,2,happy,M,"A way to set expectations, dude."
5,35,0,excited,L,Now I can talk to Olija and proceed with my graduation. Finally! I am sure I'll do my best!
